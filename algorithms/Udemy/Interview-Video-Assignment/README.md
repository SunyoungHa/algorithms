**Understanding the importance of the coding interview**
1. Enroll in this [Udemy course](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/quiz/4990668#overview)

2. Watch the following two videos and write down 2-4 observations or questions for each one.

a. [The All Important Coding Interview](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/lecture/8533042#overview)
b. [Getting Better at Coding Questions](https://anniecannons.udemy.com/course/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/lecture/8533046#overview)


Video a.
When it comes to the general job seeking process, there are two phases: Contact and Interview. During the interview phase, a company will evaluate my coding skills, which are the most important qualities and override every other quality.

Video b.
There are three ways to evaluate coding ability. First, a take-home project is something that I do on my own time and then submit to the company. Second, pair programming is more about the practical use of skills instead of algorithms or theoretical questions. Am I supposed to focus more on coding than algorithms?

The third one is Whiteboard interviews. How can I get really good at whiteboard questions? Practice, practice, practice! For example, Fizzbuzz, Fibonacci. If people who have not seen these questions before usually fail them, so do I. I solved the problems a long time ago; though, I don't think I will be able to quickly answer them now.
